## How to submit a pull request
If you don't follow this I wont be mad but it would be nice.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Make a development branch off of your forked master
4. Do code
5. Turn all of your commits into one atomic commit and rebase with my master (not super important but nice to have)
7. Submit a pull request from your forked branch to my master branch
8. Wait for me to see it!
