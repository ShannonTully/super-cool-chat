This is going to be a Chat deployed to EC2.  Pretty sure it will be on tcp using socket.io and maybe have Twilio implemented.

Definitely submit some issues and pull requests if you want.


## Future Features (maybe)
- Password protection
- super useful help menu
- Nicknames
- Direct messages
- Twilio
- rooms
- private rooms
- dm rooms
- web chat
- downloadable client (pip package)
- netcat availability
- user levels (admin, room manager, general user)
- bots (all functionallity should be available via chat)
